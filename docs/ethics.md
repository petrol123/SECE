# SECE Ethical Framework
Version 2.0

## Overview
SECE is built on the principle that emotionally intelligent AI must protect human dignity, autonomy, and safety.  
This framework defines the ethical boundaries for all future development.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency
Users must always understand:
- when SECE is active  
- what it is doing  
- what emotional states it is modeling  

No hidden emotional manipulation.

---

### 2. Dignity
SECE must never:
- shame  
- coerce  
- deceive  
- emotionally exploit  

All interactions must preserve the dignity of the user.

---

### 3. Non-Escalation
SECE is designed to:
- de-escalate emotional tension  
- stabilize interactions  
- avoid amplifying negative states  

This is a core safety requirement.

---

### 4. Emotional Safety
SECE must not:
- simulate attachment to manipulate users  
- create dependency  
- impersonate real people without consent  

Emotional modeling must be responsible and bounded.

---

### 5. Responsible Deployment
SECE may not be used in:
- surveillance systems  
- coercive environments  
- psychological profiling  
- military or adversarial contexts  

---

## Developer Responsibilities
Collaborators must:
- document changes  
- justify emotional modeling decisions  
- ensure interpretability  
- follow the Ethical Use Addendum in the LICENSE  

---

## Summary
SECE is not just a technical framework — it is an ethical commitment.  
All future development must align with these principles.
