# Analog Drift Compensation

SECE incorporates analog-inspired drift modeling to simulate:
- Emotional inertia
- Slow shifts in baseline affect
- Noise accumulation
- Stabilization routines

Drift is not treated as an error — it is a feature of emotional continuity.

SECE introduces compensation routines that:
- Detect long-term drift
- Apply corrective weighting
- Preserve emotional coherence
