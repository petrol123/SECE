# Emotional Weight Engine

The Emotional Weight Engine is the core of SECE.  
It models emotion as a dynamic, continuous signal rather than a discrete label.

Key components:
- Valence field
- Arousal field
- Resonance loops
- Emotional decay and drift
- Contextual weighting
- Stability thresholds

The engine is designed to be substrate-agnostic, but its behavior is inspired  
by analog systems where drift, noise, and resonance are natural properties.
