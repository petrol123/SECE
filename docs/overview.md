# SECE Overview

SECE (Synthetic Emotional Cognition Engine) is a modular emotional architecture  
designed to model affective processes in artificial systems.

It introduces:
- Continuous emotional fields
- Resonance-based emotional modulation
- Analog-inspired drift and decay
- A structured Emotional Weight Engine
- Transparent, interpretable emotional state variables

SECE is not an interpretability tool.  
It is an emotional computation framework.
