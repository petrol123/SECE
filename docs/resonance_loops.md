# Resonance Loops

Resonance loops model how emotional signals amplify, stabilize, or interfere  
with each other over time.

Loops include:
- Positive resonance (amplification)
- Negative resonance (dampening)
- Cross-emotional interference
- Stabilization cycles

These loops allow SECE to simulate emotional momentum and transitions.
