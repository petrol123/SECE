SECE Trust & Responsible Use Policy

Purpose

SECE (Synthetic Emotional and Cognitive Engine) is designed to explore emotional modeling, internal state representation, and human–AI interaction in a manner that prioritizes trust, transparency, and human dignity.

This policy articulates the intended use principles of SECE and establishes a shared ethical framework for contributors, researchers, and adopters.

Core Principles

Projects built using SECE should adhere to the following principles:

1. Transparency

Systems using SECE should clearly disclose when emotional modeling, affective inference, or emotionally adaptive behavior is present.

Users should not be subjected to covert emotional analysis or manipulation.

2. Consent and Agency

Emotionally responsive or adaptive behavior should be deployed only in contexts where users have meaningful awareness and agency.

SECE is not intended for use in systems that remove, obscure, or override user autonomy.

3. Non-Manipulation

SECE is not designed to manipulate, deceive, or psychologically exploit individuals.

Applications intended to influence behavior, beliefs, or emotional states without the user’s informed understanding are strongly discouraged.

4. Non-Surveillance Orientation

SECE is not intended for covert monitoring, emotional surveillance, or behavioral profiling without appropriate disclosure, consent, and oversight.

Use in surveillance, coercive, or extractive data-collection contexts falls outside the project’s design intent.

5. Identity Integrity

SECE should not be used to create synthetic agents that intentionally impersonate real individuals without consent, or that obscure the synthetic nature of the system in emotionally significant interactions.

6. Oversight in Sensitive Contexts

Deployments involving vulnerable populations, healthcare, mental health, or high-impact decision systems should include appropriate human oversight, governance, and safeguards.

Commercial Use

Commercial use of SECE is permitted under the MIT License.

Organizations deploying SECE in high-impact, emotionally sensitive, or large-scale systems are encouraged to engage transparently with ethical review processes and to align implementations with the principles outlined in this policy.

Scope and Intent

This policy does not modify or restrict the legal terms of the MIT License.

Instead, it defines the ethical and social expectations associated with SECE and provides a clear reference point for responsible adoption, collaboration, and stewardship.

Stewardship Statement

SECE is an evolving research-driven project. Its long-term value depends on trust, openness, and thoughtful use.

Contributors and adopters are encouraged to treat emotional AI not merely as a technical capability, but as a responsibility.
