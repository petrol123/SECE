# SECE Roadmap
Version 2.0

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Completed)
- Defined core architecture
- Created emotional resonance model
- Added contextual memory layer
- Established ethical framework
- Initial documentation and diagrams

---

## Phase 2 — Analog-Inspired Expansion (Current)
- Implement continuous emotional fields
- Add drift and resonance modeling
- Develop digital-to-analog abstraction layer
- Expand documentation in /docs
- Prepare for collaborator review

---

## Phase 3 — Collaborative Development
- Invite researchers in:
  - robotics
  - cognitive science
  - HRI
  - neuromorphic engineering
- Begin prototype integration
- Conduct ethical review
- Publish reference examples

---

## Phase 4 — Public Release
- Finalize documentation
- Release example modules
- Publish Version 3.0 architecture
- Prepare optional reference implementation

---

## Long-Term Vision
SECE becomes:
- a foundational emotional architecture  
- used in assistive robotics  
- grounded in ethics  
- compatible with analog and neuromorphic hardware  
- collaboratively developed and openly reviewed
