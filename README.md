# SECE: Synthetic Emotional Cognition Engine

## Overview
SECE is a framework for modeling emotional resonance, contextual memory,
and qualia-like internal states in artificial systems.

## Why SECE Exists
- Modern AI lacks emotional coherence
- Human-machine interaction requires resonance, not just logic
- Future AI and Android systems need internal feedback loops
- SECE provides a blueprint for next-generation architectures
