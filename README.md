SECE — Synthetic Emotional Cognition Engine
SECE is an open, modular framework for modeling emotion in artificial systems.
It introduces an analog‑inspired emotional architecture built around resonance, drift, valence, and continuous emotional fields, offering a new foundation for emotionally responsive AI.

Overview
SECE provides a structured approach to emotional computation through:

Emotional Weight Engine — a system for generating and updating emotional weights

Analog Drift Compensation — mechanisms for stabilizing emotional state over time

Resonance Loop Architecture — feedback loops that simulate emotional reinforcement and decay

Theoretical Whitepaper — a detailed explanation of the model, its motivations, and implementation

Diagrams & Supporting Materials — visual and conceptual aids for understanding the system

Who SECE Is For
SECE is designed to support:

Researchers exploring computational emotion and affective modeling

Developers building emotionally responsive or adaptive systems

Ethicists & Safety Experts studying emotional alignment and safe emotional AI

Anyone interested in bridging cognition, affect, and computation
