# SECE — Synthetic Emotional Cognition Engine
Version 2.0

## Overview
SECE is a high‑level research framework for emotionally intelligent AI.  
It models emotional resonance, contextual memory, and continuous internal states for use in assistive robotics, medical support systems, and human‑robot interaction.

SECE is not a product or a model.  
It is a conceptual architecture intended for future collaborative development.

## Why SECE Exists
Modern AI lacks:
- emotional grounding  
- continuity of experience  
- internal feedback loops  
- human‑aligned resonance  

SECE introduces:
- emotional weighting  
- contextual memory  
- analog‑inspired internal states  
- resonance‑based feedback loops  
- ethical guardrails

## Core Components
- Emotional Resonance Engine  
- Contextual Memory Layer  
- Qualia‑like State Generator  
- Feedback Loop Controller  

## New in Version 2.0
- Analog‑inspired emotional dynamics  
- Continuous emotional fields  
- Drift and resonance modeling  
- Hardware‑ready abstraction direction  
- Expanded ethical framework  

## Roadmap
See `ROADMAP.md` for full details.

## Contributing
SECE welcomes collaboration from researchers in robotics, cognitive science, HRI, ethics, and neuromorphic engineering.
