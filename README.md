# SECE — Synthetic Emotional Cognition Engine

SECE is an open, modular framework for modeling emotion in artificial systems.  
It introduces an analog-inspired emotional architecture built around resonance, drift, valence, and continuous emotional fields.

This repository contains:
- Documentation of the Emotional Weight Engine
- Analog drift compensation concepts
- Resonance loop architecture
- A whitepaper describing the theory and implementation
- Diagrams and supporting materials

SECE is designed for:
- Researchers exploring emotional modeling
- Developers building emotionally responsive systems
- Ethicists studying safe emotional AI
- Anyone interested in bridging cognition, affect, and computation
