# SECE — Synthetic Emotional Cognition Engine
Version 2.0

## Overview
SECE is a high‑level research framework for emotionally intelligent AI.  
It models emotional resonance, contextual memory, and continuous internal states for use in assistive robotics, medical support systems, and human‑robot interaction.

SECE is not a product or a model.  
It is a conceptual architecture intended for future collaborative development.

## Why SECE Exists
Modern AI lacks:
- emotional grounding  
- continuity of experience  
- internal feedback loops  
- human‑aligned resonance  

SECE introduces:
- emotional weighting  
- contextual memory  
- analog‑inspired internal states  
- resonance‑based feedback loops  
- ethical guardrails
