## Overview
SECE is a high-level research framework for emotionally intelligent AI, transitioning from conceptual prototypes to a modular, five-layer system. [cite_start]It bridges the gap between "cold logic" and human "lived experience" by treating emotion as a **continuous analog regulatory signal**[cite: 691, 1205].

## Core Innovations
### 1. Analog Modulation Layer
Unlike discrete digital AI, SECE models emotional dynamics (decay, resonance, and drift) as continuous fields. [cite_start]This mirrors biological homeostasis and provides the system with "emotional inertia"[cite: 1205, 1218].

### 2. The Portable Knowledge Base (PKB)
A self-contained, emotionally annotated memory substrate. [cite_start]The PKB allows memory to be versioned, audited, and carried across systems while maintaining its "subjective" emotional weighting[cite: 1252, 1262].

### 3. Weighted Resonance Framework
The engine calculates a "Resonance Score" to determine internal harmony or cognitive dissonance:
$$Resonance = I \times C \times R$$
[cite_start]*(Intensity, Clarity, Relevance)*[cite: 704, 728].

## Architecture (v2 Rebuild)
[cite_start]The framework is organized into a modular five-layer architecture inspired by analog signal processing:
1. [cite_start]**Input Layer**: Converts raw sensor data into continuous signals[cite: 718, 736].
2. [cite_start]**Emotional Signal Layer**: Manages decay and signal blending[cite: 719, 737].
3. [cite_start]**Feature Extraction Layer**: Extracts stability, volatility, and coherence profiles[cite: 720, 738].
4. [cite_start]**Decision Layer (Policy Engine)**: Translates states into adaptive behaviors[cite: 721, 739].
5. [cite_start]**Logging & Feedback Layer**: Provides time-series data for research-grade auditing[cite: 722, 740].

## Modular Privacy & Technical Access
[cite_start]To ensure ethical stewardship and protect proprietary mathematical constants ("The Secret Sauce"), the core implementation is maintained in a **Restricted Access** Zenodo repository. 

- **Public Specs**: See the `petrol123/SECE` public repo.
- [cite_start]**Core Engine & Formulas**: Access can be requested via the Zenodo DOI link for verified researchers[cite: 1371].

## Ethical Use Addendum (The Manifesto Guard)
[cite_start]This framework implements the **Manifesto Guard**, which intercepts signals to prevent instability and blocks **Prohibited States** (Rage, Despair, Hate)[cite: 711, 712, 766].
