# Contributing to SECE

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SECE (Synthetic Emotional Cognition Engine).  
This project is authored and stewarded by **Paul Totoritis**, and is currently in an early
public phase focused on documentation, architecture, and collaborative exploration.

SECE is an ongoing research and engineering effort aimed at developing emotionally
responsive, qualia-like feedback mechanisms for synthetic cognition. Contributions are
welcome from researchers, engineers, neuroscientists, and collaborators who share an
interest in ethical, transparent, and human-aligned AI systems.
