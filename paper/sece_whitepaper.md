# SECE: A Synthetic Emotional Cognition Engine

## Abstract
SECE introduces a modular emotional architecture inspired by analog systems.  
It models emotion as a continuous, dynamic signal shaped by resonance, drift,  
and contextual weighting.

## Introduction
Modern AI systems treat emotion as a classification problem.  
SECE reframes emotion as a computational process with internal dynamics.

## Architecture
- Emotional Weight Engine  
- Resonance Loops  
- Drift Compensation  
- State Transparency  

## Applications
- Affective computing  
- Ethical emotional AI  
- Human-AI interaction  
- Cognitive modeling  

## Conclusion
SECE provides a foundation for emotionally aware systems grounded in  
interpretability, analog inspiration, and ethical stewardship.
