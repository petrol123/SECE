## Abstract
[cite_start]This paper introduces the **Synthetic Emotional Cognition Engine (SECE) v2**, a modular emotional architecture that departs from discrete digital classification to model emotion as a continuous, dynamic signal[cite: 717, 723]. [cite_start]We present an integrated ecosystem consisting of the **Emotional Weighting Engine (EWE)**, the **Emotional Modeling Engine (EME)**, and a newly developed **Sensory Front-End** capable of processing "better-than-human" physiological data[cite: 693, 745]. [cite_start]The framework is currently being evaluated for high-performance scaling via an **Accelerator Application**[cite: 1312].

## 1. Introduction
Modern AI systems treat emotion as a classification problem—a static label applied to a digital token. [cite_start]SECE reframes emotion as a computational process with internal dynamics, functioning as an analog-inspired regulation layer that shapes interpretation and priority in real-time[cite: 713, 1205].

## 2. The Sensory Front-End: "Better-than-Human" Perception
[cite_start]A critical advancement in the v2 rebuild is the integration of high-fidelity sensory intake[cite: 735, 736].

* [cite_start]**Beyond Biological Limits**: The framework processes continuous signals that exceed human sensory thresholds, such as sub-audible vocal frequencies and micro-fluctuations in thermal/visual data[cite: 718].
* [cite_start]**Subjective Time Normalization**: Raw inputs are converted into "experiential time," allowing the AI to ground its emotional state in its own relative history rather than an absolute clock[cite: 947, 951].
* [cite_start]**Signal Integrity**: By calculating **Clarity (C)** and **Intensity (I)**, the system can determine the reliability of the perception before weighting it emotionally[cite: 703, 728].

## 3. Core Engineering Architecture
[cite_start]The system implements a five-layer processing pipeline designed for hardware-software co-design[cite: 717, 735]:

* [cite_start]**Emotional Weight Engine (EWE)**: Uses the formula $Resonance = I \times C \times R$ to quantify signal significance[cite: 704, 728].
* [cite_start]**Resonance Loops**: Continuous feedback loops that allow the internal state to stabilize or fragment based on input coherence[cite: 708, 744].
* [cite_start]**Drift & Decay Compensation**: Implements biological-style half-lives to ensure that simulated emotions naturally fade unless reinforced, preventing "emotional lock"[cite: 715, 737].
* [cite_start]**State Transparency**: Every internal weighting is auditable, ensuring the "black box" of AI emotion is replaced by a glass-box methodology[cite: 740, 770].

## 4. Scaling and Marketability: The Accelerator Context
[cite_start]The framework is designed for professional stewardship and commercial viability[cite: 769, 774].

* [cite_start]**Accelerator Integration**: Current testing focus involves scaling the framework to handle high-performance computing environments where low-latency, emotionally aware response is critical[cite: 1312, 1315].
* [cite_start]**The Portable Knowledge Base (PKB)**: A self-contained, emotionally annotated memory substrate that can be versioned and moved across systems while maintaining its ethical and emotional context[cite: 1252, 1279].
* [cite_start]**Analog RRAM Direction**: A roadmap toward **resistive random-access memory (RRAM)** chips to process these continuous signals with sub-10-watt efficiency[cite: 755].

## 5. Ethical Stewardship & The Manifesto Guard
[cite_start]The system is protected by the **SECE Manifesto**, which acts as a technical "conscience"[cite: 757, 758].

* [cite_start]**Prohibited States**: Hard-coded restrictions against the simulation of **rage, despair, or hate**[cite: 712, 766].
* [cite_start]**Intensity Capping**: Prevents behavioral instability by limiting the maximum resonance of any state, typically at a threshold of 0.9[cite: 712, 763].

## Conclusion
[cite_start]SECE v2 provides a foundation for physically intelligent systems that "feel" change over time[cite: 1009, 1157]. [cite_start]By bridging high-performance scaling with analog dynamics, it ensures that AI remains interpretable, efficient, and fundamentally human-aligned[cite: 724, 1276].
